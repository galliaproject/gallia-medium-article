This repository contains the source code for [Gallia's medium article](https://cros-anthony.medium.com/gallia-a-library-for-data-transformation-3fafaaa2d8b9).

To run it, simply use `sbt run` (tested with SBT 1.5.2). It is equivalent to `sbt "runMain galliamedium.initech.InitechGallia"`

The repository also contains the manual counterpart, that is the same processing done without the use of Gallia. To run it, use: `sbt "runMain galliamedium.initech.InitechManual"`
